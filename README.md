# Dark Crunchyroll Plugin
This project is originally based off of the [Dark Youtube Plugin](https://github.com/stormbreakerbg/Dark-youtube-plugin-chrome).

This plugin is currently available on the [Firefox Addon Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-skin-crunchyroll), the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-skin-for-crunchyroll/agjiicokbioponboibkfhfgmhcacafph), the [Opera Addon Store](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/dark-skin-for-crunchyroll/), and the [Microsoft Edge Extension Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/dark-skin-for-crunchyroll/9nv1zg95rh2d) 

This plugin aims to provide a quality dark theme for [Crunchyroll.com](https://crunchyroll.com).  This is primarly because dark themes are easier on the eye when in a darker environment.
It also leaves a button in the addon bar to quickly disable and reenable the theme.

If there are any unthemed pages, or other issues such as weird color choices, please report them!

See [Releases](https://github.com/tholinka/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin-Chrome/releases) for changelog.
