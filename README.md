# Dark Crunchyroll Plugin for Google Chrome
This project is entirely based off of the [Dark Youtube Plugin](https://github.com/stormbreakerbg/Dark-youtube-plugin-chrome).

The plugin can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-skin-for-crunchyroll/agjiicokbioponboibkfhfgmhcacafph?hl=en-US&gl=US).

This plugin aims to provide a quality dark theme for [Crunchyroll.com](http://crunchyroll.com).  This is primarly because dark themes are easier on the eye when in a darker environment.
It also leaves a button in the addon bar to quickly disable and reenable the theme.

If there are any unthemed pages, or other issues such as weird color choices, please report them!

See [Releases](https://github.com/link07/Dark-Crunchyroll-Plugin-Chrome/releases) for changelog.
